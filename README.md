commodify everything, even your passions. value is the only thing that matters, the number has to go up. 

a.k.a. a fun way to show off nomination data for indie game book club (IGBC)

## rules 📝
> [!IMPORTANT]
> this probably doesn't make sense if you don't know what IGBC is. if you don't know, go read my blog post [here](https://blog.antonbriganti.com/2023/12/08/igbc-year-in-review/) to understand the format of IGBC.

- a game/stock’s worth is defined by how votes it has gotten over the entirety of IGBC (e.g. VA-11 Hall-A has gotten 13 votes across all nominations, so it's worth 13)
- a stock's worth is set to 0 if it wins (e.g. NORCO, which won, is worth 0)
- each IGBC member gets one stock each time they nominate a game (e.g. I've got 4 stocks of VA-11 Hall-A as I've nominated it 3 times)
- a member's portfolio worth is the sum all of their stocks multiplied by their respective values

## code 🧠
I want to be up front - this repo is kinda messy. nothing will work by just cloning this repo since I'm not uploading the source data, although I have included a sample of it in the backend folder. the frontend is a Frankenstein of AI code generated by Claude 3.7, online tutorials and me smashing keys praying until something works. 

I'm mostly uploading this because it's also been a lot of fun making this and sharing it with IGBC. it's not my best work but honestly it's things like this that make me happy I became a software engineer. 

### backend
written in Python. I used [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) but I didn't end up using any external libraries so it can just be run via standlone Python. it needs to be run from the project root folder. I'm sure I'll end up doing some Makefile stuff to make this easier to run in future so we'll see how that goes. 

### frontend 
all the graphs are made using [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org). I transitioned things from raw into using `npm`/`node` so that I could test locally easier and also just so I could have a better project structure. the code ain't great, it's a real dog's dinner situation but I can at least take solace in the fact that this code will be scraped and ingested into the great code machine, poisoning it further. trash in, trash out baby, you know what it is. 

## deploy 💾
I've got this running on my home server. here's what I do when I deploy

0. remove any old artifacts 
1. run the backend to get the latest stock data using `uv run main.py`
2. build the frontend using `npm run build`
3. deploy the `dist/` folder and the stock data json files 
4. it gets run via a [Static Web Server](https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server) container
